you can explore about Bezier Curves!
Bezier Curve, a continuous curve in computer graphics is defined by a set of discrete control points.
It can be used in many graphics library.

**Feature 1.**
Sequential learning of De Casteljau's Algorithm, which recursively represents Bezier Curves.

**Feature 2.** Learning how to combine two Bezier Curves to create longer curves.

**Feature 3.** Exploration of 3D object created using multiple Bezier Curves.

**Feature 4.** [Playground] a space for creating desired shapes with Bezier Curves and generating animations.

Users can manipulate control points using this application to create and manipulate various Bezier curves. Through this, users can visually explore the shapes and characteristics of the curves.

To draw Bezier Curves, I utilized the Path feature of GeometryReader and employed the trim modifier for curve animation. I used the formula of Bezier curves to obtain points for drawing curves. For creating 3D objects with Bezier Curves, I applied the rotation3DEffect.
